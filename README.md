# üöó EV Charging Station Management System

## üéØ 1. Project Goals
Build an **EV Charging Station Management System** using a **microservices architecture**.  
The system serves 3 main user groups:

- **EV Driver**: find stations, make reservations, start/end charging sessions, process payments, view personal reports.  
- **Charging Station Staff**: monitor charging points, handle on-site payments.  
- **Admin**: manage stations/charging points, users, service packages, reports & revenue statistics.
